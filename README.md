# Vy - AI-Powered Semantic Memory MCP Server

> An intelligent "second brain" that combines semantic memory with strategic project management through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 🎯 Project Vision

Vy is an AI-powered semantic memory system that serves as your personal intelligent assistant. It remembers conversations, extracts insights, and helps with strategic thinking by providing context-aware suggestions and pattern recognition across your work and thoughts.

Think of it as a combination of:

- **Semantic Memory**: Vector-based storage and retrieval of conversations and documents
- **Strategic Intelligence**: Pattern recognition, goal alignment, and proactive insights
- **Intelligent Task Management**: Auto-extraction of TODOs with context-aware suggestions

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Technologies

- **Language**: TypeScript (rich MCP ecosystem support, excellent AI/ML tooling)
- **Memory Strategy**: Curated memory with intelligent condensation
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB (local-first development, cloud-scalable production)
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI assistant integration
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo for scalable multi-package development

### System Design Principles

- **Local-First**: Works offline, syncs when connected
- **Privacy-Focused**: Your data stays under your control
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability
- **Modern Patterns**: Leveraging current best practices over backward compatibility

## 🧠 Core Concepts & Design Decisions

### Two-Layer Memory Architecture

**Session Memory (Raw, Current)**:

- Full conversation fidelity during active sessions
- Available for context and clarification
- Discarded after insight extraction

**Long-term Memory (Processed, Persistent)**:

- Extracted insights, learnings, and key facts
- Optimized for semantic search and retrieval
- Condensed to overcome context window limitations

### Memory Types (Extensible Design)

Using a **composition-based architecture**, all memory types share a common structure with optional type-specific data:

- **Conversations** (Phase 1): Complete conversation threads with metadata
- **Insights** (Phase 2): Derived patterns and strategic learnings
- **Learnings** (Phase 2): Specific knowledge and facts
- **Facts** (Phase 2): Verifiable information and preferences
- **Action Items** (Phase 2): Extracted tasks and TODOs

The `Memory` interface uses composition (`conversationData?`, `actionItemData?`, etc.) rather than inheritance, allowing flexible partial objects during serialization/deserialization and eliminating complex discriminated union handling.

### Vector Storage Strategy

- **Single Collection**: `vy_memories` with type-based metadata filtering
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: text-embedding-3-small (1536D, cost-optimal)
- **Embed at Storage**: Generate embeddings when storing memories
- **Failure Recovery**: Store raw data even when embedding generation fails
- **Rich Metadata**: Support temporal, type, and custom filtering
- **UUID v7 IDs**: Time-sortable identifiers for efficient database operations

### Configuration Patterns

- **Local Development**: `createLocalConfig()` - no auth required
- **Hosted Production**: `createHostedConfig()` - explicit auth requirements
- **Environment Variables**: Standard deployment pattern
- **Validation**: Type-safe configuration with clear error messages
- **Error Recovery**: Failed embeddings tracked for batch reprocessing

### Testing Strategy

**Comprehensive Unit Testing**:

- **Error Handling**: Validates data preservation when embeddings fail
- **Memory Conversion**: Tests complex domain object ↔ ChromaDB document mapping
- **Search Logic**: Verifies distance-to-similarity conversion and relevance filtering
- **ID Generation**: Ensures UUID v7 format compliance and uniqueness
- **Failed Embedding Recovery**: Tests automatic tracking and reprocessing system

**Test Coverage**: 10/10 tests passing, focusing on critical failure scenarios and data integrity

**Modern Testing Patterns**:

- **Behavior-driven**: Test what the code does, not how it's implemented
- **Mock strategy**: Mock external dependencies, test real domain logic
- **Error simulation**: Explicit testing of failure scenarios
- **Type safety**: Runtime validation of TypeScript interfaces

### MCP Integration

The Model Context Protocol provides:

- **Three Core Tools**: `capture_conversation`, `search_memory`, `get_context`
- **Resource Exposure**: Access to stored memories as resources
- **Context Injection**: Intelligent memory retrieval for new conversations
- **Type-Safe Interfaces**: Full TypeScript definitions for all operations
